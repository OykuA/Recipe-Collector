      "1. Rub the garlic halves and thyme leaves all over the beef. Place the joint in a large dish, drizzle over the olive oil, then rub it into the meat all over. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 1–2 days before you cook it (you don’t have to marinate the beef in advance, but it does make it super tasty! – see Tip). Take the beef out of the fridge about an hour before cooking, to let it come up to room temperature.\n",

      "- 8 rashers of smoked streaky bacon\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Meanwhile, prepare the herb butter. Put the butter into a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the olive oil and mix well. Add the lemon zest and juice, crushed garlic and chopped parsley. Mix well to combine.\n",
      "1. Remove the giblets from the turkey cavity. Season the cavity well with salt and pepper, then stuff with the onions, lemon, garlic halves and 2 bay leaves.\n",
      "1. With your hands, loosen the skin on the breast from both ends of the bird so that you will be able to stuff the flavoured butter underneath it, making sure you keep the skin intact. Repeat with the skin on the legs – from the lower side of the breast feel your way under the skin and out towards the leg, loosening the gap.\n",

      "1. Place the bird in a large roasting tray, breast side up. Spread the rest of the butter all over the skin. Season well with salt and pepper, then drizzle with a little olive oil. (If preparing a day ahead, cover the turkey with foil and refrigerate at this stage.)\n",
      "1. Roast the turkey in the hot oven for 10–15 minutes. Take the tray out of the oven, baste the bird with the pan juices and lay the bacon rashers over the breast to keep it moist. Baste again. Lower the setting to 180°C/Gas 4 and cook for about 2 1⁄2 hours (calculating at 30 minutes per kg), basting occasionally.\n",
      "1. To test whether your turkey is cooked, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the leg and check that the juices are running clear, rather than pink. As oven temperatures and turkey shapes and sizes vary, it is crucial to check your turkey about 30 minutes before the calculated roasting time. If the juices are pink, roast for another 15 minutes and check again. Repeat as necessary until the turkey is cooked.\n",
      "1. Transfer the turkey to a warmed platter and remove the parson’s nose, wings and tips of the drumsticks; reserve these for the gravy. Leave the turkey to rest in a warm place for at least 45 minutes; make the gravy in the meantime. Remove the bay leaves from under the skin before carving.

      "- Fresh chopped rosemary or thyme, optional\n",
      "- Roasted Garlic Butter, optional (recipe in Notes)\n",

      "1. Prepare Focaccia dough: In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, semolina and salt. Make a well in the middle of the bowl and set aside.\n",
      "1. In a measuring cup or small bowl, bloom yeast by whisking together warm water with yeast until combined and yeast is dissolved. Stir in honey and set aside until frothy and bubbly. Whisk in olive oil and gradually stream into prepared flours. (It’s easiest to mix this together with a fork to start with and then, when it is just coming together, use your hands to make it into a ball.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth, elastic and springy to touch.\n",
      "1. Oil a large mixing bowl and place the dough inside, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 3-4 hours*\n",
      "1. Prepare pizza sauce and toppings: Pour drained San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl along with olive oil, garlic, and balsamic. Tear basil leaves into pieces, adding to bowl, and using your hands, crush tomatoes into small bite-sized pieces. This can be done a few days ahead of time, if needed as tomatoes will marinate for extra flavor. You’ll likely have a bit of sauce leftover, but it will store in an airtight container for up to a week. In a small bowl, mix together grated mozzarella, Romano, and Parmesan for pizza assembly, set aside.\n",
      "1. Preheat oven to425˚F (220˚C) and generously brush a baking sheet or metal baking dish with garlic butter (or substitute olive oil if preferred).\n",

      "1. Generously brush dough with more garlic butter, making sure to get all the sides which will ensure a crispier crust. Sprinkle with Maldon salt and herbs. Begin layering with pizza ingredients - tucking cherry tomatoes into dough and alternating with torn burrata pearls. Continue layering with sauce and grated cheeses. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and bubbly, checking halfway through, reducing oven temperature to 400˚F (63˚C) if cheese browns too quickly.\n",

      "- 2 cups (475ml) pickle brine, strained of any seeds or whole spices\n",
      "- 2 cups (490ml) buttermilk\n",
      "- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika\n",
      "- ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n",
      "- Freshly cracked black pepper\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Add the chicken pieces, shallots, garlic, dill and pickle brine to a large zip-top plastic bag or toss to combine in a bowl. In a measuring cup, whisk buttermilk with smoked paprika, salt and pepper. Pour into the bag or bowl and evenly distribute. Seal the bag or cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight, up to 24 hours.\n",
      "1. While the chicken marinates, make the Spicy Whipped Honey Butter: In a medium bowl, use a hand mixer to whip together the butter, honey, paprika, cayenne and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Set aside until ready to serve, or refrigerate and bring back to room temperature before serving.\n",
      "1. Once chicken has marinated, remove from the bag and discard the brine. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and set the chicken, skin-side up, on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack. Leave to dry out the skin and come to room temperature for at least one hour.\n",
      "1. While the chicken comes to room temperature, make the Tangy Slaw: In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegars and honey and season well with salt and pepper. Add the sliced vegetables and pickle and toss to combine. Let sit for about 15 minutes before tasting and adjusting seasoning, adding more salt or lemon juice as needed. Just before serving, add parsley and dill and toss to combine, and adjust seasoning if needed one last time.\n",
      "1. After the chicken has come to temperature, preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C) and set a rack over a rimmed baking sheet, set aside. Set up your breading station by whisking flour, cornstarch, onion and garlic powders, salt, smoked paprika, cayenne, and black pepper together in a medium bowl. In another bowl, add the buttermilk and season with salt and pepper. Place a clean baking tray or parchment paper on your work surface (this is where the breaded chicken will land).\n",
      "1. Fill a large cast iron skillet with about 2 inches of oil (but no more than ⅔ full) and place over medium heat, aming for 325˚F (162˚C). While the oil heats, bread the chicken. Starting with the dark meat, coat each piece of chicken first with a layer of the flour mixture, shaking off the excess flour before transferring to the buttermilk. Turn to coat, let the excess drip off before transferring back to the flour and coating evenly, packing the coating on with your hands. Transfer the coated piece to the parchment paper and repeat with all the remaining chicken. Once coated, the oil should be up to temperature.\n",
      "1. Once the oil is at 325˚F (162˚C), slowly lower the largest piece of chicken (should be a thigh or drumstick) skin-side down into the oil. Wait a moment before adding another piece of chicken, and be sure not to crowd the pan--this will be done in batches. Raise temperature for about 2-3 minutes immediately after adding the chicken, as the oil temperature will drop.\n",
      "1. After about 2 minutes, begin to check the chicken pieces for browning and turn the pieces to rotate as needed, ensuring that all sides of the chicken turn a beautiful golden brown, about 8-12 minutes total. Do your best to maintain the oil temperature at 325˚F (162˚C), you may have to slightly adjust the heat often. If the chicken is golden but not cooked through to 165˚F (74˚C), place the undercooked pieces on the prepared baking sheet with a rack and put into the oven for a few minutes to finish cooking. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces, sprinkling lightly with salt as soon as the chicken is out of the oil.\n",
      "1. Once all chicken pieces are golden brown and cooked through, let rest for about 10 minutes before serving as the chicken will be extremely hot. Serve alongside spicy butter and slaw.\n",

      "1. Line the bottom of an 8” springform with parchment paper (or use a trifle dish). Line the sides with acetate (or parchment) so it sticks up out of the pan by at least 6 inches.\n",
      "1. Using about ⅓ of the pound cake chunks, line the bottom of the pan or dish with a layer of pound cake, not too tightly packed but full enough to create a stable base layer. Spread half the macerated red berries into a layer, then spoon about ¼ of the whipped cream mixture over the berries.\n",
      "1. Repeat this poundcake, berry, then cream cheese process with the macerated blue and black berries in the next layer, then repeat again with the remaining red berries.

      "- ¼ cup candied ginger\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Make the Crumble: Roughly chop both pistachios and ginger and place in a sifter, letting all the pistachio dust fall through. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.\n",
      "1. Make the Rhubarb Compote: Preheat the oven to 350˚F (175˚C). Place sugar and vanilla bean and seeds in a large bowl. Use your fingers to combine the vanilla seeds and sugar, and scrape out any sugar stuck to the inside of the vanilla bean. Remove bean and reserve for another use.\n",
      "1. Add rhubarb and strawberries and stir with a spatula until coated evenly. Transfer the mixture to a large baking dish, trying to keep everything in a single layer if you can. Pour the Prosecco all over the mixture and transfer to the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes, without stirring, until everything is tender. Allow to cool completely before using. Compote can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n",
      "1. Make the Cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 6-inch aluminum cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Grease and flour the pans well.\n",
      "1. In a medium bowl, whisk together cake and all purpose flours, baking powder, salt and pistachio flours. Set aside.\n",
      "1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the browned butter on medium until smooth. Add sugar and beat on medium-high until light, fluffy and a bit pale, about 3-5 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.\n",
      "1. Reduce speed to medium low and add eggs, one at a time until incorporated, and vanilla. Scrape down the bowl again.\n",
      "1. Add about ⅓ of the flour mixture on low speed. Once incorporated, add about ½ of the buttermilk. Repeat, alternating between the flour mix and buttermilk, ending with the last ⅓ of flour. Be careful not to overmix, stop the mixer just as you see the last of the flour being incorporated. Scrape down bowl again to ensure everything is evenly mixed.\n",
      "1. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans, about 290g each. If you don't have three pans, the remaining batter can be held at room temperature for a couple of hours. Bake until edges are golden, about 22-24 minutes, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out just barely clean.\n",
      "1. Cool cakes in their pans for about 15 minutes before tipping out of their pans, then set on a wire rack to cool completely before assembling.\n",
      "1. Make the Buttercream: Create a double boiler by placing a medium saucepot filled with about 2 inches of water on the stove over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Place the egg whites and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk to combine, then place the bowl on top of the steaming water (make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water).\n",
      "1. Whisking occasionally, heat the egg mixture until it registers 160˚F (71˚C) and remove from heat. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk on high speed until the mixture holds almost-stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. The outside of the bowl should no longer feel hot to the touch. Remove the whisk attachment and switch to the paddle.\n",
      "1. On low speed, add butter a few tablespoons at a time, letting it fully incorporate before adding more. Once all the butter is added, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the mixture is silky and smooth, about 3-5 minutes. Once the buttercream is smooth, add sour cream and salt and mix on medium until combined. Transfer the  mixture to a piping bag and set aside until ready to use.\n",
      "1. Make the Sticky Ginger Toffee: Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and boil for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar, until thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Optionally, strain the mixture to remove any gritty ginger strands leftover. Sauce can be used immediately or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, just make sure to reheat before using.\n",
      "1. Assemble the Cake: If the cake layers are domed or uneven, use a serrated knife to level the cake layers. Starting with one layer, spread a layer of buttercream over the entire cake using an offset spatula. On top of this, pipe about a ½-inch thick ring around the edges of the cake layer, creating a sort of nest for the rhubarb compote. Use a slotted spoon to remove the rhubarb and strawberries from the sugar liquid and place a smattering on top of the frosted cake layer, letting some of the rhubarb pieces hand off the edges of the cake. Drizzle some sticky ginger toffee sauce all over the cake, then repeat all this with the next layer. For the top layer, turn the cake round upside down and use the bottom of the cake as the top for presentation. Use the offset spatula to make whimsical swoops and swirls in the frosting, then top with more rhubarb and strawberries. Drizzle a final layer of toffee sauce all over the cake, focusing on the edges of the top layer so it drips over the sides.\n",
      "1. Top the cake with Pistachio Ginger Crumble just before serving.\n",

      "1. While Beats are roasting, prepare filling: Whisk together goat cheese, crème fraîche, ricotta, and Parmigiano Reggiano until well combined. Season with herbs, meyer lemon zest, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Place in a piping bag or  for easy filling and set aside.\n",
      "1. Remove from oven and cool enough to handle, peeling away skin and discarding. Puree beet on high adding just enough of the roasting liquid (or red wine vinegar) to blend until smooth. Set aside 84 grams (3 ounces) for pasta and reserve.\n",
      "1. Make the pasta dough: Place both flours onto a flat counter or wooden cutting board and use a fork to form a well in center. Season the center of the well with salt and add the olive oil. Crack eggs into the center along with beet puree. Using a fork, whisk together eggs and puree until smooth, continue whisking pulling in the flour from the interior of the circle. You can guide the circle to keep its shape by coaxing with your hand. Continue to whisk until almost all of the flour has been incorporated. If dough feels too dry add a touch of water (or olive oil for a bit more shine), alternatively if dough too wet sprinkle lightly with flour, as needed.\n",
      "1. Using a bench scraper, bring the rest of the dough together with hands. Dust surface with more “00” flour and knead for about 10 minutes until dough is smooth and springy to the touch. Wrap tightly in plastic and rest for 30 minutes to an hour*\n",
      "1. While pasta rests - make Beet Green Pesto: In a food processor pulse together garlic, toasted pistachios, beet greens, parsley, basil and half the parmesan until finely chopped. With motor running, stream in olive oil until pesto is loosely blended. Season with meyer lemon zest, salt, pepper, and big squeeze of lemon juice.\n",
      "1. When ready to roll: Unwrap your pasta dough and place it on a clean, cool, dry working surface, like marble. For easier pasta shaping, let filling come to room temperature at this time.\n",
      "1. Divide dough into quarters, and working with one piece at a time, roll the dough with a small dowel or rolling pin to about 3x3” square. Beginning with the machine on its highest setting, feed the rolled out pasta dough into the machine. When it’s halfway through, pull it out. When you’ve run it all the way through the machine, pull it out and aerate the dough. Repeat 2 or 3 times on the first setting. Lightly flour your hands each time.Using the back of your hand, fold the dough. Then change the setting on your pasta machine to 1.Crank the dough through the machine. After 10 turns of the machine, catch the dough and stretch and fold the dough. Change the setting on your machine to 2 and repeat. Repeat 10 times, flouring your hands and increasing the setting each time, until your pasta is smooth and as thin as tracing paper - this is about a 5 on any pasta roller.\n",
      "1. Next cut and shape the cappelletti: Dust a baking sheet with semolina and lay out rolled pasta dough on a lightly floured surface (a pastry brush and a pinch bowl of flour is very handy here). Using a 3-inch pastry cutter (or rim of a glass) cut circles out of the pasta dough. Pipe or spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of goat cheese filling into each circle and shape into cappelletti by folding in half to form a “half moon” pressing to adhere edges. To complete the shape (with arc facing up) bring the two ends together with your index finger and thumb to create the cappelletti shape or “little hat” and set aside onto prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining pasta*\n",
      "1. Prepare wine butter sauce: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine wine, shallot, and thyme and cook until reduced by half. Remove thyme and shallots and discard. Whisk in butter and season with salt and pepper, keep warm over low heat while cooking pasta.\n",
      "1. To cook pasta: Heat a large pot of water to a gentle rolling boil and generously season with salt. Working in batches place cappelletti into pot and “spin” into water, carefully give the pot a gentle turn as well to prevent pasta from sticking to each other (or sinking to bottom). Cook for 2 - 2½ minutes until pasta is al dente.\n",
      "1. Using a skimmer remove al dente pasta, shaking off excess water, and toss in white wine butter sauce to coat, spooning sauce over cappelletti to coat. To serve - divide amongst bowls and garnish with a drizzle of sauce, pesto, a sprinkling of herbs and grated Parmigiano Reggiano.\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Make the Honeycomb Toffee: Line a 9\"x9\" baking dish with parchment paper.\n",
      "1. In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the sugar, corn syrup, honey and water.\n",
      "1. Stir to combine, then attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pot (or have an instant-read thermometer ready).Without stirring, let the mixture boil until it reaches 300˚F (150˚C), about 5 minutes.\n",
      "1. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vanilla and baking soda. Quickly and carefully whisk to combine--as you do, the mixture will rapidly bubble and expand. Do not overmix, only about 5 seconds total so as to not deflate the mix.\n",
      "1. Use a spatula to carefully transfer the mix into the prepared baking dish, then lightly sprinkle all over with flaky salt. Leave the pan, undisturbed, to cool completely and set, about 2 hours.\n",
      "1. Once set, peel the parchment paper off the toffee and crack it between your hands (or use the butt of a knife handle) to break into large chunks. Continue to break it up into bite-size pieces, reserving any of the small bits that break off as well. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n",
      "1. Make the Honeycomb Cake: Prepare an ice bath. Place the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Shake the pot to spread the sugar then do not touch it, and let the sugar melt and caramelize. This may take a while so be patient, up to 10-15 minutes. Once all sugar has dissolved and has an amber color, add half of the hot water and stir to combine, being careful as the sugar will bubble and spit. Add the rest of the water and stir to combine.

      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 pounds cara cara oranges, about 3 medium, washed and patted dry\n",
      "- Zest and juice of 1 lemon\n",
      "- 4 cups (800g) granulated sugar\n",
      "- 2 cloves\n",
      "- 2 cardamom pods\n",
      "- 1 cinnamon stick\n",
      "- 1 vanilla bean\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Start by making the Cara Cara Jam: Cut the oranges in half, then cut each half in half lengthwise. Slice each orange quarter as thinly as possible, discarding the top and bottom ends and any seeds. Place slices and any leftover juice in a medium bowl and add lemon zest and juice. Add sugar to the bowl and stir with a spatula to coat all the orange slices in sugar. Place a small plate or other flat object on top of the fruit to submerge the oranges in liquid. Cover with plastic wrap and let macerate overnight at room temperature (or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is warm).\n",
      "1. After macerating, transfer the mixture to a large, heavy-bottomed pot and place over medium-high heat. Add cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla bean and 4 cups of water and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer. Simmer for about 90-120 minutes, until the liquid has reduced to a jammy consistency and the thermometer reaches 220˚F (104˚C). Immediately remove from the heat. Carefully remove the whole spices and vanilla bean, then use an immersion blender to blend the jam to a creamier consistency.\n",
      "1. Let the jam cool a bit before transferring to airtight containers, and let the containers cool completely before sealing, labeling and storing in the refrigerator. Jam will keep for 3 months, but always look for signs of mold before consuming after it’s initial opening.\n",
      "1. Make the Hot Cross Buns: In a small saucepan, combine the water roux ingredients. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to a paste, about 1-2 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and transfer to a small bowl to chill.\n",
      "1. Rehydrate the dried fruit by adding dried raisins, currants, rum and water to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, letting simmer for about 2 minutes before removing from heat and letting soak for 5-10 minutes. Once plump and hydrated, strain and discard the liquid. Pat the fruit dry and set aside.\n",
      "1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the cooled water roux with all of the dough ingredients except the raisins, currants and citrus peel. Mix on low speed for 3-5 minutes, scraping down the sides occasionally, until the dough is soft and elastic. It will still be very sticky and will still fall to the bottom of the bowl (rather than sitting in a ball on the dough hook). Add in the raisins, currants and candied citrus peel, mixing again on low speed until the fruit is incorporated into the dough. You may need to use a spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to incorporate.\n",
      "1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour. The dough might not double in size, but it should have risen significantly. Generously grease two 9\" x 13\" baking dishes.\n",
      "1. While the dough rises, make the rum glaze: Place water, rum and orange peels in a small skillet and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer then carefully tilt the skillet towards the flame to ignite the rum. Let the alcohol burn for a few seconds before blowing to extinguish. Add the sugar and reduce heat to let simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the glaze is reduced slightly and fragrant. Remove from heat and let the orange peels infuse until ready to use.\n",
      "1. Once risen, turn out the dough onto a greased work surface, and grease your hands as well. Use a knife or bench scraper to divide the dough into quarters, then divide those quarters in half. Each eighth of dough should weigh about 175g. Shape the 8 portions into balls (they don’t need to be perfect). From there, divide each of the balls into quarters, leaving you with 32 pieces of dough. Grease your hands well throughout this process to make the sticky dough easier to work with.\n",
      "1. Use your hands to roll each portion into a neat ball, tucking and pinching the underneath side closed. If any fruits fall out, simply stick them in the bottom of the ball and reseal. Arrange the dough balls evenly between the two baking dishes (you will have 2 extra balls, tuck them in at the top of one of the baking dishes).\n",
      "1. Let the dough rise again for about 1 hour. While the dough rises, make the cross paste: in a small bowl, combine the flour, water and butter with a spatula and mix until smooth.

      "- ¼ cup (50g) + 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, divided\n",
      "- ½ cup (4 oz) whole milk, room temperature\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons (45g) brown sugar\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1 egg\n",
      "- 2 egg yolks\n",
      "- 3 cups (420g) bread flour\n",
      "- ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n",
      "- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Make the dough: In the bowl of a standing mixer combine yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Stir to combine and let sit until foamy and tripled in volume, about 10 minutes. Add remaining sugar, milk, light brown sugar, vanilla, egg, and egg yolks and whisk to combine. Add flour and salt and mix on medium-low speed with a dough hook and knead dough for 5-8 minutes, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball on the hook. Reduce the speed to low and add the butter a couple of tablespoons at a time, waiting until most of the butter is absorbed before adding more. Continue to knead about 2-5 minutes, until the dough passes the windowpane test (see note below).\n",
      "1. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 ½ –2 hours. Alternatively, place the covered bowl in the refrigerator overnight for a slow proof.\n",
      "1. While the dough rises, make the fillings: Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl with a hand mixer until well-combined and fluffy. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon and sugar; set aside. In another small bowl, use a fork to whisk together the egg and water for the egg wash. Set aside.\n",
      "1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Use aluminum foil to create 4 balls about 1-inch large and coat with baking spray; set aside. Once the dough has risen, lightly punch down dough and turn it out onto a very lightly floured work surface. Use a knife to divide the dough in half. Using a rolling pin, roll the first half of dough into a 20x6-inch rectangle. Use just enough flour to make rolling out possible, you don’t want to over-flour.\n",
      "1. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the surface of the dough with melted butter, leaving about 1-inch unbrushed along the top edge. Lightly sprinkle the entire surface with half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, trying to avoid the top inch.\n",
      "1. Cut about 1-inch off of the tip of the piping bag and pipe a line of cream cheese filling along the long bottom edge of the dough.\n",
      "1. Use your fingertips to lift the bottom of the dough up and over the cream cheese, and gently continue to roll the dough all the way up until it meets the other end. Use your fingers to pinch the seam together, then trim the uneven ends off and discard (no more than 1-inch per side). Use a knife to cut the roll into two even halves. Gently push the two ends of one half together to form a circle and pinch the dough together on all sides, being careful not to let any of the cream cheese squeeze through.\n",
      "1. Repeat with the second half and set both circles on one prepared baking sheet. Repeat this entire process with the other half of dough. Place one foil ball in the center of each dough circle to help keep the shape while baking. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175˚C).\n",
      "1. Uncover cakes and brush all over with egg wash. Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the dough reaches 190˚F (87˚C) and the cakes are golden brown. Let cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.\n",
      "1. While the cakes bake, make the glaze: in a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. It should be the consistency of royal icing, thick but still flowing. Set the rack over a baking sheet. Once the cakes are mostly cooled, pour icing evenly over the cakes so that it drips slightly over the sides. Decorate immediately with sprinkles in an alternating pattern before the icing dries, or frost then sprinkle individually.\n",
      "1. While the cakes cool, make the maple glaze: In a small saucepan over medium heat, add the butter, brown sugar and maple syrup. Once the butter has melted and the sugars have started to dissolve, add the pecans and salt. Let the sauce bubble and thicken for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and carefully add the heavy cream. Return to heat and let boil for another 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a moment.\n",
      "1. To serve, stack the mini king cakes on top of each other and carefully spoon the maple pecan glaze all over the stack.\n",
      "1. Note: Using wet fingers, gently use your hands to stretch a small portion of the dough apart. If the dough tears quickly, the gluten is not developed enough yet and you need to knead for longer. If the dough stretches thinly without breaking and you can see light through it, the dough is ready.\n",

Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, then turn off the oven and let it sit in the oven for a few hours until fully cooled. Do not open the oven door throughout any of the cooking and cooling processes. Remove from the oven at least 3 hours after turning it off.\n",
      "1. Make the Raspberry Curd: Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium heatproof bowl. If planning to use the curd soon after making, prepare an ice bath. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until fully melted. If the butter starts to bubble, lower the heat. Add raspberries, sugar, egg yolks, lemon juice and salt and whisk to combine. Cook for 7-9 minutes, until the mixture reaches at least 160˚F (70˚C) and has started to thicken like pudding.\n",
      "1. Strain through the mesh strainer, discard any solids and stir lemon zest  into the strained curd. Taste for seasoning and, if using soon, place in the ice bath and stir often to cool it down quickly.

      "Title: Pork and Chive Dumplings with Black Vinegar Dipping Sauce\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 ½ cups (200g) dumpling or bread flour\n",
      "- ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n",
      "- ½ cup water, room temperature\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Make the dumpling dough: Place flour and salt in a medium bowl and stir with chopsticks. Slowly add in almost all the water as you stir with chopsticks, but don’t use the entire cup at first. As you mix, a shaggy dough mixture will start to form. If the dough isn’t coming together, add the remainder of the water and continue to mix. Use your hands to knead the dough either in the bowl or on a clean work surface for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 20-25 minutes. Knead the dough for another 5 minutes then cover with a slightly damp kitchen towel. Let rest for another hour.\n",
      "1. While the dough rests, make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients and mix with chopsticks or your hands. Stir everything together until just combined, and place in the refrigerator until ready to use.\n",
      "1. Make the dipping sauce: Gently toast the spices in a small, dry skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer spices to a small saucepan with the vinegar, soy sauce and sugar. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and allow to cool.\n",
      "1. Once the dough has rested and is soft to the touch, divide into 4 pieces and roll those pieces out into a long log about 1” thick. Cut each log into ½-inch pieces, each piece should weigh between 11-13 grams and as uniform in size as possible. Roll each piece into a ball and store, sprinkled with flour so they don’t stick, underneath a damp kitchen towel. Working one at a time, flatten the ball into a small round disk with the palm of your hand. Use a small rolling pin or 1-inch thick wooden dowel with one hand and hold the disc in the other hand. Working in small movements, start to flatten the dough with the pin, rolling up from the bottom, and turning about ⅛ rotation each time you roll, so the disc begins to flatten into a wrapper. Continue this process, adding more flour as needed so nothing sticks, until the dough has turned into about a 3 ½-inch circle.\n",
      "1. The dough should be very thin but not so thin that the filling will rip through, with the edges being thinner than the middle of the circle. Place the wrapper on a floured surface and cover with a damp towel. Repeat this process until all the dough is used.\n",
      "1. Using a tablespoon or chopsticks, scoop the filling into one dumpling and fold the wrapper in half over the filling to make a half circle. Use floured fingers to pinch the middle of the half circle together, then start by crimping the front half of the wrapper towards the middle, repeating 2-3 more times until you get to the end of the half circle. Repeat this with the remaining unsealed half, until the entire dumpling is tightly sealed in a neat, crimped package. Place on a lightly floured plate or tray and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Repeat until all the filling is used.\n",
      "1. To cook: Set a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan and fill the pan with dumplings, giving them about ½-inch of space in between. Pour about ⅓ cup of water into the pan and cover with a lid. Let steam until all the water has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy, about 1-2 more minutes. Remove the dumplings from the pan and set on their sides (as you don’t want to let the crispy bottoms get soggy). Serve immediately, or continue cooking another batch of dumplings. Uncooked dumplings can be frozen raw for up to 2 months. Cook from frozen in the same manner, but add ½ cup water and steam for 8-10 minutes.\n",
      "1. To serve, divide dumplings among plates and pour the dipping sauce into individual bowls. Top dumplings with scallions and cilantro.\n",

Add breadcrumbs and toss to coat in the fat, adding a touch more oil if the breadcrumbs look dry. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and toasty, about 3-5 minutes.\n",
      "1. Immediately transfer the still-hot potatoes to a large bowl and toss with about ¾ of the cheese, adding a bit in at a time as you toss or stir, and a generous amount of black pepper. Transfer the potatoes to a serving platter and top with half of the remaining ¼ of cheese and more black pepper. Top with pancetta breadcrumbs, chives, and parsley leaves and serve immediately.\n",

      "Title: Turkey Wellington\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1, 2-3 pound turkey breast, deboned and skin removed\n",
      "- Avocado or vegetable oil\n",
      "- Kosher salt\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Prepare the Turkey: Lay out the breast and, if needed, use a sharp knife to butterfly the breast to create an even thickness throughout. Pound slightly if needed Season the turkey breast generously with salt on all sides and set on a sheet tray lined with a wire rack. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n",
      "1. Cook the Turkey: Preheat the oven to 250˚F (120˚C).\n",
      "1. Roll the turkey breast up into a cylindrical shape and use kitchen twine to truss and hold this shape. Tear off a large square of heavy duty aluminum foil and place the trussed turkey breast at the bottom center of the square, closest to you.\n",
      "1. Drizzle a tablespoon or two of oil over the turkey and use your hands to coat all over. Clean your hands, then lift the bottom of the square of foil up and over the turkey, carefully but tightly rolling it into a perfect cylinder. Tighten the two ends by twisting like a candy wrapper and tuck them towards the same side as the seam of foil.\n",
      "1. Place this, seam side up, on a clean sheet tray lined with a wire rack and place in the oven. Cook for about 2 hours, until a thermometer reads at least 160˚F (71˚C)  when inserted into the very center of the turkey. Let cool for 30 minutes then remove foil to cool further.\n",
      "1. Make the Crepes: Place all ingredients in a blender and blend on high for 15 - 30 seconds, until the batter is smooth and no pockets of flour remain.\n",
      "1. Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Grease the skillet by pouring a small amount of oil into the pan and wiping it all over the surface with a paper towel. Pour a scant ⅓ cup of the batter into the skillet, tilting to coat the surface of the pan evenly. Cook for 1–2 minutes, until the batter looks dry on top. Flip and cook for about another minute, making sure the crepe does not get any color. The crepe should still be pale, soft, and pliable rather than golden and crisp. Transfer the crepe on a baking sheet or plate and while you repeat with the remaining batter, lightly greasing the pan with more shallot oil between crepes.\n",
      "1. Make the Stuffing: Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool for a few minutes. Once cooled, add the remaining ingredients to the large bowl and mix with your hands to combine. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.\n",
      "1. Assemble: Stack the 4 crepes on top of one another and trim the edges to make a large square.\n",
      "1. Lay two long pieces of plastic wrap on a work station, overlapping by about 4 inches. Lay the 4 crepes down to make one large square, overlapping each by at least ½-inch. Scoop 2 cups of the stuffing onto the bottom part of the crepe square, and press into another square that starts at the very bottom of the crepe square and reaches about ¾ of the way up the crepe square, leaving a few inches of crepe empty on the top. Press into a solid layer as thin as possible, about ¼-inch thick. Be sure to wash your hands after handling the raw stuffing before moving on to the next step.\n",
      "1. Carefully cut and remove the twine from the turkey, ensuring that it stays in the cylindrical shape. Place it at the very bottom of the crepe and stuffing square and, letting the plastic wrap do the work for you, tightly and carefully roll upwards away from you until the bottom edge of the crepe reaches the top and overlaps slightly. Use a paring knife to trim off any excess crepe from the top and sides, leaving at least a 1-inch border all around. Tuck in these sides and make sure no plastic wrap is still stuck in between the crepe layers. Roll all the way over the top with the plastic wrap and use the same technique you used to wrap the turkey breast cylinder in foil. Fold the crepe edges on the sides into themselves, creating a tight bundle where no stuffing nor turkey is exposed. Tighten the two ends by twisting like a candy wrapper and tuck them towards the same side as the seam of plastic wrap.\n",
      "1. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. While this freezes, remove the puff pastry from the freezer and let thaw.\n",
      "1. Once pastry is thawed, you will repeat a similar process to envelope the crepe-covered turkey breast in the puff pastry. Lay two long pieces of plastic wrap on a work station, overlapping by about 4 inches. Using a rolling pin, roll each square of puff pastry to a width that is at least 2 inches wider than the turkey cylinder. The pastry should be about ⅛-inch thin. Brush a thin layer of egg wash on the bottom edge of one pastry square and lay the second pastry square directly below it, overlapping by ½-inch. Use the rolling pin to seal the two pastry squares together. Brush the entire pastry with egg wash.\n",
      "1. Remove the crepe cylinder from the freezer and carefully unwrap and discard the plastic wrap. Set the cylinder at the bottom of the pastry rectangle and use the same process to encase the cylinder in the puff pastry. Roll upwards away from you until the bottom edge of the puff pastry reaches the top. Trim away excess pastry, leaving 1-inch extra to overlap. Seal the bottom edge of pastry to the top edge by brushing lightly with the egg wash and pressing together. Trim any excess dough from the sides, leaving just enough to encase the cylinder, about ½-inch. Create a tight bundle again by twisting the ends and rolling back and forth on the work surface. Tuck the ends underneath the seam side and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Place a sheet tray in the oven to preheat as well--this will prevent a soggy bottom.\n",
      "1. Remove the wellington from the freezer, then remove the plastic wrap and place seam-side down on a piece of parchment paper. Score an appealing pattern on top using the back of a paring knife, then brush the entire surface with egg wash. Sprinkle with flaky salt. Carefully remove the hot sheet tray from the oven, lift the parchment paper and wellington onto the hot tray and return to the oven.\n",
      "1. Cook for 40-45 minutes, until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown. Rotate the pan 180˚ halfway through baking and, if desired, brush a second time with the egg wash. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve with cranberry sauce alongside.\n",

      "Title: Roast Turkey Breast and Gravy\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- ¾ cup unsalted butter, room temperature\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons chopped sage\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons chopped rosemary\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons chopped thyme\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, finely grated\n",
      "- Zest of 1 lemon\n",
      "- ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).\n",
      "1. Make the compound butter: Place all ingredients in a medium bowl and stir with a small spatula to combine evenly. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.\n",
      "1. Pat the turkey breast dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Rub half of the compound butter underneath the skin of the turkey breast and the remaining half of butter all over the outside, including the bottom and sides.\n",
      "1. Place a wire rack inside a clean roasting pan. Set the turkey breast skin side up in the pan and place on the center rack of the oven. Baste every 15 minutes with the fat rendered in the pan. About halfway through into roasting, carefully pour the ½ cup stock into the pan so the juices do not burn. Roast for 45-55 minutes total, until cooked through and skin is crisp and golden and the juices run clear. An internal thermometer should register at least 155°F (68°C), keeping in mind that cooking will carry over and continue as it rests.\n",
      "1. Let the breast rest on a cutting board while you make the gravy, and tent with foil if desired.\n",
      "1. Carefully pour all the pan drippings into a glass jar or heat-proof measuring cup, let sit for a few minutes to settle and separate. Spoon off 1 tablespoon of fat that separated to the top and transfer to a small saucepan. Heat over medium for a moment and add flour, stirring to form a roux. This will make a thick paste. Let this paste cook for a minute before slowly pouring in chicken stock, whisking to incorporate smoothly. Discard any remaining fat from the pan juices and whisk the remaining juice into the gravy.\n",
      "1. Let the gravy cook, lowering the heat to simmer if needed, whisking frequently, for about 3-4 minutes until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, if needed.\n",
      "1. Remove the gravy from the heat while you slice the turkey. Serve immediately.\n",
