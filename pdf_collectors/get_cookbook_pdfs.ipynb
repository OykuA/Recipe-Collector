      "Recognize the Problem\n",
      "The bread-making suggestions in this bulletin have been adapted to meet conditions\n",
      "which are common throughout the State of Utah. Our high altitudes and dry atmosphere make\n",
      "problems in bread-making which are quite different from those found in lower elevations and\n",
      "more moist climates.\n",
      "You will find, in the pages which follow, many changes from the bread-making methods\n",
      "and recipes prepared for use at sea level.\n",
      "We need more liquid, less yeast, more and shorter rising periods, and a higher baking\n",
      "temperature to make really good bread in our Utah homes.\n",
      "Read the general instructions before you try any of these recipes. They will help you to\n",
      "understand why these methods are recommended. Follow the directions carefully and you will\n",
      "have uniformly good bread and rolls every time you make them.\n",
      "Methods, tests and recipes are given in much detail, to help those of you with little\n",
      "experience develop skills which will result in high quality baked products. Use of these skills can\n",
      "save you money as well as time and energy.\n",
      "4-H Foods club leaders will use the information to give some of their club members their\n",
      "first lesson in bread-making.\n",
      "Some new homemakers may also use these instructions for their first bread-making.\n",
      "Experienced homemakers who are veterans in the art of making bread may find a few\n",
      "ideas which can help them.\n",
      "The methods and recipes in the pages which follow, come to you as a result of several\n",
      "years of testing in different parts of Utah. Many of our homemakers and 4-H club members have\n",
      "adopted these bread-making practices. They report much improvement in the quality of their\n",
      "breads.\n",
      "The general instructions in the first part of this bulletin apply both to the plain and to the\n",
      "fancy yeast breads. You will find when you turn to the recipe section that the “Sweet Yeast\n",
      "Doughs” call for more ingredients than do those for the “Staff of Life” bread. Methods of\n",
      "handling the two doughs differ slightly.\n",
      "Learn to Know Good Bread\n",
      "GENERAL APPEARANCE\n",
      "A good loaf of bread is symmetrical\n",
      "in shape with a good volume. It is smooth\n",
      "on the top with no bulges or lumps. It has a\n",
      "well rounded dome showing good “oven\n",
      "spring.” It has an evenly “shredded break”\n",
      "around the sides of the loaf, just above the\n",
      "top edge of the pan.\n",
      "Three Well Shaped Loaves of Bread\n",
      "“Oven spring” is the quick rising\n",
      "that takes place during the first 10 minutes\n",
      "after the bread goes into the hot oven. This “oven spring” happens before the heat sets the cell\n",
      "walls and before the bread starts to brown.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The “shredded break” develops during the “oven spring.” The oven heat comes in contact\n",
      "first with the part of the loaf just above the pan. This part expands quickly, so the shreds of\n",
      "gluten stretch suddenly. Some of them break. Others bake in the stretched form and give an\n",
      "appearance of shredded wheat.\n",
      "A well baked loaf of bread has a rich golden brown color on all sides. The top may be\n",
      "slightly darker brown than the sides or bottom of the loaf.\n",
      "Sides cut from the center of a well shaped loaf are very little larger than those cut near the\n",
      "ends. A well shaped loaf given a slice of bread which measures about the same in both directions.\n",
      "The crust on high quality bread is thin, crisp, and tender.\n",
      "THE CRUMB\n",
      "The color of good white bread is uniformly creamy white. Whole wheat will be darker,\n",
      "depending on the percent of whole wheat flour used.\n",
      "The texture of good yeast bread shows moderately small, rather uniform cells with thin\n",
      "cell walls. Good bread is free from streaks or extremely close grain. The freshly cut surface has a\n",
      "velvety feel, both to your fingers and to your tongue. As you press the crumb, it is soft, elastic,\n",
      "and springy. There are no hard spots or knots in the crumb of high-quality bread.\n",
      "The flavor of good bread is rather bland. It has the sweet nut-like flavor of the wheat.\n",
      "Good bread has good eating quality. Both the flavor and the texture combine to make this good\n",
      "eating quality.\n",
      "KEEPING QUALITIES\n",
      "Bread which is made and cared for according to recommendations in this bulletin will\n",
      "stay fresh a reasonable length of time. Good bread does not dry out or get stale quickly.\n",

      "The right kind of equipment will help you do the whole process of bread-making more\n",
      "efficiently. You can make good bread without all of the things listed below. Some of them may\n",
      "seem non-essential, but they do make the job much easier and the results more satisfying.\n",

      "Leave the pans in the oven until the oven cools. This tempering makes any tin pan dull and\n",
      "slightly darker so the bread will brown sufficiently. Cookie sheets or cake pans made of tin also\n",

      "You can knead with a firm push without tearing the dough surface.\n",
      "RELAX THE DOUGH\n",
      "If the dough seems tense and hard to handle during the kneading, instead of elastic and\n",

      "Know How the Dough Ferments\n",
      "When liquid is added to wheat flour to make a dough, gluten is formed from proteins in\n",
      "the flour. Gluten makes an elastic framework which holds the tiny gas bubbles made by the yeast.\n",
      "Kneading spreads this gluten evenly through the dough.\n",
      "During the fermentation period the dough rises. The yeast cells feed on the sugar to form\n",
      "carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. It is this gas which makes the dough rise. The gas bubbles are\n",
      "held in the tiny spaces between the elastic framework of the gluten.\n",
      "This elastic framework we call the cell walls. As the yeast forms more gas, these cell\n",
      "walls stretch to hold this gas. This stretching makes them very thin. The thinner and more\n",
      "delicate the cell walls, the better the bread will look and taste.\n",
      "Although these cell walls are very elastic, they can be stretched too far. If the dough is\n",
      "allowed to get too light at any stage, the cell walls will collapse and a poor quality of bread will\n",
      "result.\n",
      "The “ripe test” tells when the cell walls have stretched far enough so the dough will be\n",
      "just right for its first “punch down.”\n",
      "The gluten becomes mellow as well as elastic during the fermentation period. These\n",
      "changes improve the flavor of the bread.\n",
      "If the fermentation goes on too fast, either from too much temperature or too much yeast,\n",
      "there will not be time for these necessary changes to take place in the gluten.\n",

      "symmetrical in shape on the outside, and which have uniformly good texture on the inside.\n",
      "Mold the loaves on the canvas-covered kneading board without putting more flour on the\n",

      "loaves without it sticking to the canvas or to your hands.\n",
      "The flour which you mixed and kneaded into the dough in the beginning has gone\n",
      "through several changes during the fermentation period. If you put more flour onto the kneading\n",
      "board or canvas when you mold the loaves, you will have heavy streaks of unfermented flour in\n",
      "the finished bread. This makes the bread unattractive as well as unpalatable.\n",

      "Do not put fat on your hands before molding the loaves, or you may have streaks of fat\n",
      "where the dough will not seal together. This will leave cracks inside the finished loaf.\n",
      "LEARN TO MOLD THIS WAY\n",
      "Divide the finished dough into the number of loaves you are making. Roll each piece into\n",
      "a ball and cover to prevent drying while it rests 10 minutes. After each ball of dough has had its\n",
      "final rest period, mold the loaves this way:\n",
      "1. Flatten and pound the ball of dough\n",
      "into an oblong shape with the palms\n",
      "of your hands. Pound the gas\n",
      "bubbles out of the dough. Keep the\n",
      "corners square. Have the dough\n",
      "about 10 inches long and 6 inches\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "2. Fold the dough in half lengthwise\n",
      "with the folded side toward you.\n",
      "3. Press out the air by pushing from\n",
      "the folded side. Seal the open edges\n",
      "of the dough by pressing firmly\n",
      "with the edge of your palm.\n",

      "fingers will not break through it.\n",
      "Slap the center of the dough gently\n",
      "onto the kneading board. This\n",

      "this stage it will be about 15 inches\n",
      "long and 5 inches wide.\n",
      "5. Place the lengthened piece of dough\n",
      "on the kneading board parallel to\n",
      "your body. Fold almost one-third of\n",
      "the dough back on itself. Keep the\n",

      "Plan to Bake It Right\n",
      "The two most important points to follow in baking bread the right way are:\n",
      "1. Put good dough which has been cared for properly, into the oven when the\n",
      "dough has just reached the right stage of lightness.\n",
      "2. Have the oven hot enough when you put the dough into it. Put the dough into\n",
      "an oven which has been heated to 450°F.\n",
      "If the dough is too light, you will have poor bread with every coarse texture. If it is not\n",
      "light enough, the baked bread will be coarse and heavy.\n",
      "When the oven temperature is too low, the dough goes on rising, and gets much too light\n",
      "before the cell walls are set. This results in poor quality bread with some of the faults you read\n",
      "about back in the temperature pages. The bread may come out of the oven with shell crack, or\n",
      "shell top or overhang.\n",
      "Use these tests to tell you when the dough is just “ripe” for baking.\n",
      "1. Press the little finger gently into the dough at one corner of the pan. If the dent stays\n",
      "in, the dough is ready to bake. If it does not, the dough needs more time. If the dough\n",
      "collapses around the dent, it has gone beyond the point of being just right. It is too light.\n",
      "2. Note the volume increase. The dough at this stage may be just doubled in bulk, or\n",
      "slightly more, or slightly less than doubled. This will depend on the kind of flour used.\n",
      "3. Make a cardboard gauge. We have worked out one test in Utah which many\n",
      "homemakers use to tell when the dough is ready for the oven. We make a cardboard\n",
      "gauge with the right size opening. We put this over the pan of rising dough at intervals, to\n",
      "tell us just when the dough is light enough to go into the oven.\n",
      "White dough made from all purpose flour, using our standard recipe, will be ready to\n",
      "bake when it is 3¾ inches above the bottom of the standard size loaf pan. Whole wheat dough\n",
      "will be ready when it is 3¼ inches above the bottom of the pan.\n",
      "MAKE THE CARDBOARD GAUGE THIS WAY\n",
      "Cut two pieces of heavy cardboard 12 inches long\n",
      "and 6 inches wide. Cut an opening in one card 5½ inches\n",
      "wide and 3¾ inches high. This makes the gauge for white\n",
      "dough. Cut the opening in the second card 5½ inches wide\n",
      "and 3¼ inches high. This measures the whole wheat\n",
      "dough.\n",

      "the cardboard above it, the dough is just right\n",
      "for the oven.\n",
      "17\n",
      "HAVE THE OVEN READY\n",
      "Make sure that the oven is ready for the bread when the bread is ready for the oven. Place\n",
      "the oven rack so the center of the loaf from the top to bottom will come in the center of the oven\n",
      "from top to bottom.\n",
      "If your oven bakes unevenly, put the rack higher or lower as needed to insure uniform\n",
      "browning on the top and bottom of the loaves.\n",
      "Some of the newer ranges have ovens deep enough to bake two layers of bread at the\n",
      "same time. When you bake two layers at once, place the pans of dough in the oven so the loaves\n",
      "on the top rack are not directly above the ones on the lower level. This alternating of the loaves\n",
      "will permit better heat circulation.\n",
      "Put the loaves into an oven which has been pre-heated to 450°F. Bake at this temperature\n",
      "the full 35 to 45 minutes, unless your particular oven browns the bread too fast on top. If you\n",
      "have this trouble with your oven, keep it at 450°F for the first 15 or 20 minutes. Then turn it\n",
      "down to 400°F or 425°F.\n",
      "This high temperature at the beginning will stop the yeast action and set the cell walls so\n",
      "the bread will not get too light.\n",
      "When you open the oven door too often to look at the bread inside, you will need to\n",
      "increase the baking time.\n",
      "We have better bread in Utah’s high elevations when we bake it a shorter time at 450°F\n",
      "than when it goes into a cooler oven for a longer time.\n",
      "Good bread shows a good “oven spring.” This develops from the right combination of\n",
      "oven heat and stage of lightness of the dough. This combination permits a quick rising of the\n",
      "dough, followed by a quick setting of the cell walls during the first 10 or 12 minutes before the\n",
      "browning of the loaf takes place.\n",
      "When the bread has baked long enough it will shrink slightly from the sides of the pan. It\n",

      "1. Sushi is normally eaten fresh---right after it is made.\n",
      "2. Its main ingredient, rice, is both a protein and a\n",
      "carbohydrate. White rice is an excellent source of thiamin\n",
      "(vitamin B1), magnesium, iron, zinc, and niacin (vitamin B3).\n",
      "Brown rice has all of these vitamins in even greater quantity,\n",
      "plus it has more fiber.\n",
      "3. Rice vinegar is made from brown rice. Its health benefits are\n",
      "many. Because it is made from brown rice, it has a huge amount\n",
      "of amino acids; it helps prevent cholesterol; helps stop the\n",
      "formation of damaging free radicals; and it is a potent anti-\n",
      "bacterial. Vinegar, high in acetic acid, helps the body absorb\n",
      "all nutrients, making it a superb addition to almost anything\n",
      "you eat.\n",
      "SushiQuik.com 42\n",
      "4. Nori is a seaweed and seaweeds are famous for being loaded\n",
      "with minerals, vitamins, and iodine, as well having high levels\n",
      "of vitamins A and C. Iodine helps keep cholesterol down. Nori is\n",
      "fat free and low calorie. And nori contains Lignans, which have\n",
      "properties that help fight cancer.\n",
      "5. When you take all of the above and combine them with fresh\n",
      "vegetables and proteins, you have almost the perfect meal in a\n",
